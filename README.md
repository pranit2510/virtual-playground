# Virtual Playground Website

A cutting-edge website for Virtual Playground (virtualplayground.io), a revolutionary platform that unifies all LLMs (Language, Image, and Video Generation models) under one subscription.

## Features

- Immersive 3D interface with parallax scrolling
- Seamless light/dark mode toggle
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Interactive 3D elements using Three.js
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Modern UI components with micro-interactions

## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- Framer Motion for animations
- Styled Components for styling
- React Router for navigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-playground.git
cd virtual-playground
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```

## Development

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write meaningful component and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Component Guidelines

- Keep components small and focused
- Use styled-components for styling
- Implement proper prop types
- Add error boundaries where necessary

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy load routes and heavy components
- Optimize 3D models and textures
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper code splitting

## Deployment

1. Build the production version:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting service.

## Contributing

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
